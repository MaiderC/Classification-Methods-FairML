## Guidelines
1) Find measures used in the literature for evaluating when a classifier is fair. Several measures have been proposed. Elaborate on their strong and weak points to evaluate fairness.

2) Find in the literature different approaches that have been proposed to learn fair classifiers

3) Applied some of the found algorithms/proposals in the well-known dataset compass https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danofer/compass

4) Find more datasets, apply two or three fairness-enhancing methods and evaluate the results
